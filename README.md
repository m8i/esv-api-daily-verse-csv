esv-api-daily-verse-csv
=======================

Use the ESV API to generate a CSV file that can be consumed by digital signage.

Thanks to our friends at Crossway Bibles and Good News Publishers, we have access to the awesome ESV API (http://www.esvapi.org/)

They also make available a great verse-of-the-day feature with HTML and XML support.

Here's a real quick and easy script to consume their XML verse-of-the-day and to output it as a CSV.

Why would you want this? Well, if you use Four Winds Interactive or other digital signage solutions that can consume CSV files, it'll be quick and easy for you to layout your verses on digital signage.

Please make sure to play nice and follow the rules at http://www.esvapi.org/

Cheers!
